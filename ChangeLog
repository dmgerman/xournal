Version 0.3 (Jul 23, 2006):

  - vertical space tool can move items to next page (only when the entire
    block being moved has crossed the page boundary; items on the new page
    are not moved)

    paper size, color, and style commands
  - change in the behavior of the selection upon switching between tools
