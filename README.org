#+STARTUP: showall

* This is a testing repository for new features of Xournal

This is a mirror of the git repository of Xournal
(http://xournal.sourceforge.net) and contains experimental code that
is not yet in the official repo. Its purpose is to help in the
development of new features

It should *not be used* for code intended for further distribution.

* Xournal

Xournal is hosted in sourceforge at [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/xournal/][http://xournal.sourceforge.net/]]
with a mailing list located at sourceforge too
[[http://sourceforge.net/p/xournal/mailman/]]

The latest official version of xournal can always be found at
[[http://xournal.sourceforge.net/]]

* Where to find the code

** Official Repository

The official repository of xournal is managed under git. It can be
found in sourceforge at: [[git://git.code.sf.net/p/xournal/code%20xournal-code][git://git.code.sf.net/p/xournal/code
xournal-code]]

For compatibility reasons a CVS repo is still maintained and it mirrors the
git repository, but its use is deprecated.

** Experimental repository

The Xournal development team has an experimental repository where new
features of Xournal are tested before they are incorporated into the
official version. These features are not considered to be
stable enough for wider distributions and should be considered as
unstable and prone to crash.

The experimental repository is hosted at github in the
following repository [[https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal]]

Currently this repository contains the following [[https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal/branches][branches]]:

1. [[https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal][Master]]. *DO NOT* use this branch as the basis of your code.
1. [[https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal/tree/upstream][upstream]]. Its purpose is to mirror the official repository. Use
   this branch as the basis to develop your new features.
2. for-denis. This branch is expected to be merged into the official
   repository. It contains features that are ready to be included in
   his repository.
3. [[https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal/tree/next][next]]. This branch is for integration of several features that have
   been considered solid, but not yet incorporated into the official
   repository.
4. [[https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal/tree/gtk3][gtk3]]. It is an advanced effort towards porting xournal to
   gtk3+. Currently Xournal uses gtk2+
5. Other experimental branches. They will contain features that are
   being tested before they are deployed to a wider audience.

The repository is likely to contain other branches with other
experimental features.

** How to contribute

One of the features that characterizes Xournal is its
robustness. Features that make it to the official repository should be
rock-solid and error-free (to the extent that this is feasible).  In
order to guarantee this we propose the following workflow:

1. New ideas should be posted as a short proposal to the mailing list
   (xournal-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, you can subscribe here
   http://sourceforge.net/p/xournal/mailman/). Xournal developers will
   be able to comment whether the idea fits within the vision of
   xournal. They might also provide valuable comments and advice, and
   direct to existing code (such as experimental branches).
2. Make a clone of the *upstream* branch of the github repo
   https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal/tree/upstream
3. Develop your feature, test it.
4. When it is ready, submit a pull-request to Daniel (github user
   dmgerman). Make sure your commits are rebased to the upstream
   branch to facilitate integration. Submit only one feature per
   request.
5. If the feature aligns with the short and long term goals of
   Xournal, Daniel will incorporate your changes as a branch, where
   they will be tested by others. At this point it becomes an
   experimental feature. The name of the branch will reflect the
   feature. Ideally each independent feature should be incorporated
   into a separate branch. That will facilitate testing and code
   review. Daniel will make sure the feature is continuously rebased
   to the front of official.
6. Daniel will evaluate the feature for inclusion into next, where it
   can be used along many other features not yet in official (and
   further tested).
7. Simultaneously, Denis will evaluate the feature for inclusion in
   official. If he accepts the feature, it will be submitted to him
   via the for-denis branch.
8. Once the feature is merged into official (and hence into next) the
   branch is removed.
