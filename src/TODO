List of features to be implemented (not in any particular order)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- paste text directly into xournal, from xournal?
    (instead of starting a text item and pasting into it)
- internationalization / translation of interface
- integration into desktop environment (document icons/previews? 
       mime type? click on xoj opens it? list app in start menu?)
- rewrite printing using GtkPrint + Cairo as GnomePrint replacement
   (keep GnomePrint option for compatibility with GTK+ <2.10)
- xournal_page-shadow.diff (Martin Kiefel Feb 5 2007)
- "organizer" side panel (hierarchy of notes), cf. gjots
- xoj2pdf on command line
- 'insert blank page after' command (more useful in PDF annot !)
- load images as bg if given on command-line (as with PDF on commandline)
- load PDF pages only on demand (create empty pixmaps at first if can
   parse PDF geometry ourselves, else try pdfinfo ??)
   (and config option to limit total memory usage for PDF bitmaps)
- lasso selection tool (see shoffsta patch)
     (http://shoffsta.afraid.org/Projects/Xournal/)
- flatten (incl undo/redo...) - enabled only if nlayers>1
- resize selection
- color chooser (papercolor, pen color); maybe more default colors
- printing: print-options, save printer settings (throughout a session,
   and on disk) (maybe a separate config file .xournal/gnome-print-settings)
- help index
- pressure sensitivity
- insert images (screen capture or from file or from clipboard), 
  not as full-page backgrounds (new ITEM type)
- more pen/highlighter shapes (chisel)
- convert to/from Jarnal format; to/from MS Journal format???
- recalibration upon screen resize / compensation for miscalibration
    (use ConfigureNotify event and XInput? cf "Bugs" tracker 08/2007)
- find a better behavior for vertical space tool across page boundaries ?
   config options? 1) when there's not enough space at bottom of page:
                       - resize the page
                       - move stuff to next page
                       - move stuff to a new page
                   2) when moving to another page:
                       - move everything
                       - move only what doesn't fit (??? looks hard)
   option for vert space tool to also move the background??
   (PDF: cut-and-crop by running PDF code twice with 2 different clipboxes?)
- copy/paste of an entire page (beware if PDF bg is not compatible!)
- simple drawing tools: rectangles, ellipses
- option to save all annotated files within the .xoj
- non-antialiased version for handhelds
- customize autogenerated save file names 
- layer dialog box to set visibility status of each layer regardless of
  which layer is being edited
- display corruption on scroll down when bottom of window is obscured??
  (probably a gnomecanvas or X bug -- expose event generated for wrong
  region, or not processed?)
- bitmap preview for document icon in desktop environments?
- autosave at a regular interval in a given location
- keep only a few pages of a PDF file in memory at any given time; generate
  pages by parsing pdf info rather than generating bitmaps for all of them.
- win32 port (Matteo Abrate)
- snap-to-grid tool? (Matteo Abrate)
- option to auto-save preferences on exit (Michele Codutti)
- EPOS 7/24/07: Thumbnails pane
- EPOS: Connect to EPOS api which sends A4 mapped points
- EPOS: Cut and Paste into OpenOffice applications and the GIMP (as bitmap??)
- EPOS: Export pages to pictures in the Jpg and Png formats.
- EPOS: Rotate Ink in custom angle.
